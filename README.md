# Template for Ethereum Client

- Make sure to replace the "http://localhost:8545" URL with the actual JSON-RPC endpoint of your Ethereum node.
- You need to have a running Ethereum node with JSON-RPC enabled.
- Install the required Go packages using:






```bash
go get -u github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
```




## Considerations

This is just a simple example, and building a complete Ethereum client involves handling many more aspects of the Ethereum protocol, such as syncing with the network, managing transactions, handling smart contract interactions, etc. If you are interested in building a production-ready Ethereum client, consider contributing to existing Ethereum client implementations like Geth or Pantheon.
